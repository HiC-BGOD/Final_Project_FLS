This is my horror game and I add a Killer that haunts this underground church/dome that chases you and kills you and added a lot of functionality to the game along with the sound where there are sound queues like when he sees you and when he is chasing you along with a flashlight the player can use by pressing F and to walk is WASD and I made a Locker hiding system that allows you to hide from the enemy when you click E you go inside hiding and I added many other things and I created the the whole map this time and add the quest to win the game where you have to find the ORb and then put the org in the RIng of starts which breaks the curse and relases the enemies curse and kills him and you win the game I showed all of this in my video I also created multple interfaces and systems to work together for this game to be possible and filled in the critereia I hoped you enjoyed my game I loved every second of makin git and it was a blast and thank you so much for this course it was so much fun and I love Unreal and was all around an amazing expereince and class. Thank you for everything!
